# Number Puzzles!

For my 7-year-old: You can draw four different images onto a grid. Then, when you generate the puzzle, it produces numbers so that if you colour in the even ones, you get the first image back. Then, if you colour in the numbers with magnitude greater than 100, you get the second image. The negative numbers give you the third image. The numbers divisible by 3 give you the fourth.
